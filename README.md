# GooWeather

Welcome to GooWeather! An app created using SwiftUI and published to the App Store on the first try. 
This app utilizes the openweathermap API to obtain weather information and uses UserDefaults and CoreData to persist data.

GooWeather's creation was inspired by Google's weather app that is only available on Android. 
As a former Android user and huge fan of their weather app, losing such a great UI was a huge loss for me.
So, I set out to build my own app but for iOS devices.

While this app is published to the App Store, it is still a work in progress and not yet what I envision it to be.
There are a number of features I would like to add to bring it closer to Google's version.
